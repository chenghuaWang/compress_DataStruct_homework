this program focus on compress.(a data struct homework)
mode:
-h    to print this file,some mode options include.
-RLC:
    -c     E.g '-RLC -c from_pth to_pth' compress by RLC method.
    -d     E.g '-RLC -d from_pth to_pth' decompress by RLC method.
-LZW:
    -c     E.g '-LZW -c from_pth to_pth' compress by LZW method.
    -d     E.g '-LZW -d from_pth to_pth' decompress by LZW method.
-HUF
    -c     E.g '-HUF -c from_pth to_pth' compress by huffman method.
    -d     E.g '-HUF -d from_pth to_pth' decompress by huffman method.
    
    important: the file compressed by LZW must be .nz, it's a binary file
    So,in -c to_pth & -d from_pth must be "/default.nz".
